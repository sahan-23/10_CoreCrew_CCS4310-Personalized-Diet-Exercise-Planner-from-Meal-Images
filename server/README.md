# Generated FastAPI Backend (tailored guess for frontend: unknown)

This backend was auto-generated to match a typical frontend that was uploaded. I attempted to extract and scan the frontend to find API calls; extraction result: {"rar_exists": true, "rar_size_bytes": 57823, "extracted": false, "method": null, "methods_tried": ["unrar", "7z", "bsdtar", "tar", "rarfile_module_failed"]}.

## What I created
- `main.py` - FastAPI app, CORS, includes router at `/api`
- `app/routes.py` - CRUD endpoints for `/api/items`
- `app/schemas.py` - Pydantic models
- `app/models.py` - SQLAlchemy models
- `app/crud.py` - Simple CRUD functions using SQLite
- `app/database.py` - DB connection (SQLite `app.db`)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Run locally
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Notes
- The scaffold exposes `/api/items` endpoints; if your frontend expects different endpoints I detected, update `app/routes.py` accordingly.
- If I couldn't extract your frontend (check extraction summary above), please re-upload as a ZIP or paste key frontend files. I tried to detect endpoints: None detected
