ðŸ“¢ Deep Learning Mini Project
This repository contains the implementation and documentation of our Deep Learning Mini Project for the Deep Learning Module (Faculty of Computing â€“ SLTC Research University).

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
As part of the coursework, our team (10 members from multiple specializations) has developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) integrating frontend, backend, and a deep learning model with explainable AI (XAI/LLM integration).

ðŸ”¹ Project Scope
Selected Topic: (Specify your chosen topic here)

Objective: Build an AI-powered solution that demonstrates deep learning capabilities with clear explainability.

ðŸ”¹ Deliverables
âœ… Fully working MVP with frontend & backend

âœ… Deep Learning model integrated into the system

âœ… Explainability features (XAI/LLM)

âœ… Complete documentation, datasets, and video demo

âœ… Architecture diagram, setup guide, and usage instructions in this README

âœ… 10-minute presentation (architecture + live demo)

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
Deep Learning frameworks: (TensorFlow / PyTorch / etc.)

Frontend: (React / Vue / etc.)

Backend: (Flask / FastAPI / etc.)

Cloud & Deployment: (AWS / GCP / etc.)
