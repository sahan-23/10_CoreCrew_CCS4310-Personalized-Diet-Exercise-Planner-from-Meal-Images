✅ Project Topic
Personalized Diet & Exercise Planner from Meal Images

The idea:

Users upload a meal image.

The system detects the meal, estimates nutritional values (calories, carbs, protein, etc.), and suggests personalized diet & exercise recommendations.

🏗️ Project Development Plan
1️⃣ Group Formation
Form a team of 10 members.

Ensure at least 2+ specializations are represented (SE, IS, DS, Cloud).

🔹 Team Members
22ug1-0323 W.G.K.C. De Mel
22ug1-0460 A.V.D. Amarathunga
22ug1-0459 S.S.D. Fernando
22ug1-0281 P.N.M.S.S. Wijesinghe
22ug1-0471 K.K.P. Bimsara
22ug1-0472 K.G.P. Kavishka

2️⃣ Architecture Overview
The system can have:

Frontend: Web/App (React, Flutter, or simple HTML/CSS/JS) for uploading images and showing results.

Backend API: Flask/FastAPI serving the model and handling requests.

Model:

Food image classification (CNN/Transfer Learning with VGG16, ResNet, or EfficientNet).

Calorie estimation using a food database.

Recommendation Engine: Suggests diet & exercise based on detected food and user profile.

XAI: Use Grad-CAM or SHAP to explain why the model predicted a certain food.

Cloud: Deploy on AWS/GCP/Azure (use free tier).

3️⃣ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js / Flutter Web

Backend: FastAPI / Flask

Database: Firebase / MongoDB / MySQL (any)

Model: TensorFlow / PyTorch

XAI: Grad-CAM visualization

Cloud: AWS EC2 + S3 or any cloud VM
